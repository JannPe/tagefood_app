# Tagefood

...is a personal Tagebuch (German for Diary)  to help you raise your food awareness. The user may quickly and easily keep track on what kinds of food he/she is having for each meal. Also skipped meals can be entered in only seconds. 

Tagefood supplies different review screens which allow the user to see how his or her eating behavior developed over time and can hereby easily raise his/her food awareness.

## Getting Started

Make sure to have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. This documentation gives you a step-by-step guide for each operating system to do so:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install 
Furthermore, for installing I can recommend this playlist which guides you through the process for Mac and Windows:

Afterwards it is suggested to download and install Android Studio to open the code in it. Run "dart pub get" [https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get] to install its dependencies. 
If you navigate to the pubspec.yaml file, android studio should also in the top of the code supply a button, saying "Get Dependecies", which fires this command. Use Android Studio to run the app via a simulator [https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator] or a local physical device.

## Tech Stack

As a mobile flutter-app [https://flutter.dev]  the program uses Dart as its language.
