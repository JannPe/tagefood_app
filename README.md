# Tagefood

...is a personal Tagebuch (German for Diary)  to help you raise your food awareness. The user may quickly and easily keep track on what kinds of food he/she is having for each meal. Also skipped meals can be entered in only seconds. 

Tagefood supplies different review screens which allow the user to see how his or her eating behavior developed over time and can hereby easily raise his/her food awareness.

## Getting Started

Just download this repository and run "pug get" [https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get] to install its dependencies. Afterwards it is suggested to open the code in android studio and to run it via a simulator [https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator] or a local physical device. 

## Tech Stack

As a mobile flutter-app [https://flutter.dev]  the program uses Dart as its language.
